SecureFile Hackathon Demo Document
=====================================

This is a sample document for demonstrating the SecureFile blockchain integrity system.

Document Details:
- Created: July 12, 2025
- Purpose: Hackathon demonstration
- Technology: Blockchain-based file verification
- Security: SHA-256 cryptographic hashing

Content Summary:
This document represents a critical file that needs integrity verification.
Any modification to this content will be detected by the blockchain system.

Features Demonstrated:
1. File upload with automatic hashing
2. Immutable blockchain storage
3. Real-time integrity verification
4. Tamper detection capabilities
5. Audit trail maintenance

Use this file to test:
- Upload and secure the file
- Verify the original file (should pass)
- Modify this file and verify again (should fail)
- Verify using only the SHA-256 hash

The SecureFile system ensures complete data integrity and security.
